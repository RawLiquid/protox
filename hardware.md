## STM8S003F3P6 Pinout

I haven't checked most of the pins. Here are the ones I've hooked up to the logic analyzer so far. Will update as I find out more

Pin | Function
--- | --------
 1 | 
 2 | 
 3 | 
 4 | 
 5 | 
 6 | NRST (from datasheet)
 7 | VSS (from datasheet)
 8 | 
 9 | VDD (from datasheet)
 10 | 
 11 | 
 12 | Not sure what this is for. When I press the forward/back trim buttons, a ~74kHz square wave shows up here.
 13 | MOSI/MISO - They seem to use a bidirectional pin for SPI data
 14 | 
 15 | SCK
 16 | SPI CS/SS
 17 | Not sure what this is for either - It starts high and goes low once a device is connected. Could be green LED control perhaps?
